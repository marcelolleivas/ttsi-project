# ttsi-project

This is a repo where I'm putting all the codes related to automated tests from Treinamento de Testes de Software para Iniciantes - TTSI.

It has three folders on the root, which of them a solution for the activities:
1. Unit Tests (unit_tests_exercises);
2. API Tests (api_tests_exercises);
3. E2E Tests (e2e_tests_exercises);

All the activities where written with Python or frameworks that manipulate it. 

For more details, please click on the folder you want and read the README from it.
